# Environmental Justice Analysis in the UK

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the intersection of environmental justice, socioeconomic deprivation, and public health outcomes in the UK. It uses advanced data science techniques to identify vulnerable areas and inform policy development.

## Motivation

Environmental justice is a critical issue, as disadvantaged communities often bear a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards. This project aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers to address these disparities and improve public health.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The project consists of several analysis modules located in the `src/` directory. To run the main analysis pipeline, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
python src/run_analysis.py
```

To run the advanced analysis modules, use the corresponding scripts:

```bash
python src/run_advanced_analysis.py
python src/run_pollutant_analysis.py
python src/run_causal_analysis.py
python src/run_domain_analysis.py
python src/run_spatial_analysis.py
```

*(Note: Ensure your virtual environment is activated before running scripts.)*

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

```
UK_ENV/
├── docs/                      # Supplementary documentation files
├── notebooks/                 # Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and experimentation
├── src/                       # Main source code for analysis modules and scripts
├── .gitignore                 # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
├── LICENSE                    # Project licence information
├── README.md                  # This file: Overview, setup, usage instructions
├── requirements.txt           # List of Python dependencies for reproducibility
└── outputs/                   # (Git-ignored) Directory for generated outputs (figures, tables, etc.)
```

## Data

This project relies on external datasets that are **not included** in this repository due to size and potential licensing restrictions. The primary datasets required are:

*   **Unified Air Quality and Deprivation Dataset**: Contains air quality metrics, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores, and an environmental justice index at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level.
*   **Health Indicators Dataset**: Contains respiratory health indicators at the Local Authority District (LAD) level derived from NHS Outcomes Framework Indicators.

Users need to acquire these datasets independently. Placeholder instructions or links for obtaining the data should be added here if available. For example:
*   *[Link to Data Source 1 or Download Instructions]*
*   *[Link to Data Source 2 or Download Instructions]*

Once obtained, it's recommended to place the data in a local `data/` directory (which is ignored by Git via `.gitignore`) for the scripts to access it (adjust script paths if necessary).
