# Environmental Justice Analysis in the UK

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the intersection of environmental justice, socioeconomic deprivation, and public health outcomes in the UK. It uses advanced data science techniques to identify vulnerable areas and inform policy development.

## Motivation

Environmental justice is a critical issue, as disadvantaged communities often bear a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards. This project aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers to address these disparities and improve public health.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The project consists of several analysis modules. To run the main analysis pipeline, use the following command:

```bash
python run_analysis.py
```

To run the advanced analysis modules, use the corresponding scripts:

```bash
python run_advanced_analysis.py
python run_pollutant_analysis.py
python run_causal_analysis.py
python run_domain_analysis.py
python run_spatial_analysis.py
```

## Data

The project uses the following datasets:

*   **Unified Air Quality and Deprivation Dataset**: Contains air quality metrics, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores, and an environmental justice index at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level.
*   **Health Indicators Dataset**: Contains respiratory health indicators at the Local Authority District (LAD) level derived from NHS Outcomes Framework Indicators.

The data is located in the `data/` directory.
