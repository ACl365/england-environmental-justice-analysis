# Environmental Justice Project: Comprehensive Analysis Summary

## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical intersection of environmental justice, socioeconomic deprivation, and public health outcomes in the UK. Using advanced data science techniques, we've developed a comprehensive analytical framework that moves beyond basic correlations to provide actionable insights for policy development.

## Analytical Framework

Our analysis follows a progressive, multi-layered approach:

1. **Foundation: Basic Environmental Justice Analysis**
   - Correlation analysis between pollution, deprivation, and health
   - Creation of environmental justice indices
   - Identification of vulnerable areas

2. **Advanced Analytical Components**
   - Advanced Cluster Analysis
   - Multivariate Pollutant Interaction Analysis
   - Causal Inference for Policy Impact Assessment
   - Domain-Specific Deprivation Analysis
   - Spatial Autocorrelation and Hotspot Analysis

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Cross-component analysis
   - Policy recommendation synthesis
   - Intervention prioritization framework

## Key Findings

### Environmental Justice Patterns

- **Spatial Clustering**: Environmental justice issues are not randomly distributed but form distinct spatial patterns across England
- **Domain Specificity**: Living Environment Deprivation (r=0.129) and Housing & Services Barriers (r=0.128) show the strongest correlations with pollution
- **Hotspot Areas**: Bradford consistently appears as a hotspot for NO2-related vulnerability, while Nottingham dominates PM2.5-related vulnerability indices
- **Spatial Autocorrelation**: Significant spatial autocorrelation in environmental justice indices indicates that neighboring areas tend to have similar vulnerability levels
- **Neighborhood Effects**: Spatial regression models reveal that an area's environmental health is influenced by conditions in surrounding areas, not just local factors

### Pollution-Health Relationships

- **Causal Effects**: High NO2 exposure has a negative effect on respiratory health (ATT = -0.0387)
- **Pollutant Interactions**: Strong negative correlation between NO2 and O3 (r=-0.514) suggests complex atmospheric chemistry
- **Threshold Effects**: PM10 shows a threshold effect at 13.83 μg/m³, with health impacts accelerating above this level
- **Intervention Benefits**: A 20% reduction in NO2 shows the highest average improvement in respiratory health (+0.0460)

### Policy Implications

- **Targeted Areas**: Cambridge, Westminster, and Tower Hamlets would benefit most from NO2 reduction
- **Domain-Specific Approaches**: Different aspects of deprivation require tailored interventions alongside pollution reduction
- **Pollution Reduction Targets**: Optimal pollution reduction levels identified (20% for NO2) to maximize health benefits
- **Spatial Intervention Strategies**: Interventions in high-risk areas can have positive spillover effects on neighboring areas due to spatial autocorrelation
- **Cluster-Based Policies**: Policies targeting identified spatial clusters can be more efficient than uniform approaches across all areas

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources

- **Unified Air Quality and Deprivation Dataset**: Contains air quality metrics (NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5), Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores, and an environmental justice index at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level.
- **Health Indicators Dataset**: Contains respiratory health indicators at the Local Authority District (LAD) level derived from NHS Outcomes Framework Indicators.
