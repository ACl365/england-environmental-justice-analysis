# Environmental Justice and Health Inequalities: A Geospatial Analysis of Air Pollution, Deprivation, and Respiratory Health in the UK

## Project Overview

This research project addresses the critical intersection of environmental justice, socioeconomic deprivation, and public health outcomes in the UK. Using data science techniques and geospatial analysis, this study examines how air pollution exposure disproportionately affects different communities and quantifies its relationship with respiratory health outcomes. The project has implications for environmental policy, public health interventions, and social equity planning.

## Research Questions

1.  **Primary Research Question**: To what extent do socioeconomic deprivation and air pollution exposure combine to create "double disadvantage" areas with disproportionately poor respiratory health outcomes?

2.  **Secondary Research Questions**:
    *   Is there a threshold effect in air pollution exposure that correlates with significant deterioration in respiratory health?
    *   How do different pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3) interact to affect health outcomes?
    *   What is the spatial distribution of environmental injustice across the UK?
    *   Which areas should be prioritized for pollution reduction interventions to maximize health benefits?

## Datasets

This project utilizes two datasets:

1.  **Unified Air Quality and Deprivation Dataset**: Contains air quality metrics (NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5), Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores, and an environmental justice index at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level.

2.  **Health Indicators Dataset**: Contains respiratory health indicators at the Local Authority District (LAD) level.

## Methodology

The project will involve data integration and preprocessing, environmental justice analysis (including the development of a composite vulnerability index and cluster analysis), statistical analysis (correlation, threshold, and interaction effect analysis), geospatial analysis (visualizations, hotspot analysis, and spatial regression), and intervention analysis (prioritization model and simulation of health outcomes).

## Expected Outcomes

### Research Findings

1.  Quantification of the relationship between air pollution, deprivation, and health outcomes.
2.  Identification of environmental justice "hotspots" requiring urgent intervention.
3.  Development of a validated environmental vulnerability index for policy planning.
4.  Estimation of potential health benefits from targeted pollution reduction.

### Deliverables

1.  **Interactive Dashboard**: Geospatial visualization of vulnerability indices and scenario planning for interventions.
2.  **Policy Recommendation Report**: Evidence-based prioritization framework for interventions.

## Innovative Aspects

This project advances the field through:

1.  **Novel Environmental Justice Metrics**: Development of a multi-dimensional environmental justice index.
2.  **Advanced Spatial Analysis Techniques**: Application of emerging methods in spatial statistics.
3.  **Causal Inference Framework**: Implementation of quasi-experimental designs.
4.  **Explainable Machine Learning**: Use of interpretable machine learning methods.
5.  **Open Science Approach**: Public availability of code, methodologies, and non-sensitive data.
6.  **Policy Simulation Tools**: Interactive tools for simulating health impacts of interventions.
