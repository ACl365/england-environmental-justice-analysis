             <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
             <!-- Using Option 2: Short Intro + Key Bullet Points -->
             <p>This project provides actionable intelligence for tackling environmental injustice in England by identifying specific communities facing a 'double burden' of high pollution and deprivation, linked to poorer respiratory health. Using an integrated approach combining spatial, machine learning, and quasi-causal methods, key findings reveal:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Significant spatial clustering:</strong> Environmental injustice is geographically concentrated, not random.</li>
                 <li><strong>NO₂ Health Impact:</strong> Higher NO₂ exposure is significantly associated with poorer respiratory health, even after controlling for area deprivation (via PSM).</li>
                 <li><strong>Distinct Area Profiles:</strong> Local Authorities exhibit different patterns of pollution/deprivation/health, requiring tailored policy responses.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>The analysis enables targeted resource allocation and NO₂ reduction strategies (est. benefit: ~1.5 million residents based on the total population of the top 10 LADs identified for prioritization), supporting a holistic, place-based approach.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge: An Unequal Burden</h2>
            <p>Across England, disadvantaged communities often face disproportionately high levels of air pollution (like NO₂ and PM2.5). This recognised environmental injustice is strongly linked to poorer health outcomes, particularly respiratory conditions, exacerbating existing inequalities and placing significant burdens on public services like the NHS. Addressing this effectively requires moving beyond simple correlations to understand the complex interplay between where people live, their socioeconomic status, and their health.</p>
            <p><strong>My Goal:</strong> To rigorously analyse these connections using an integrated data science approach, identify high-risk areas with precision, and provide robust, data-driven evidence to support effective, targeted policy interventions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section" id="approach">
            <h2>My Analytical Approach: Integrating Diverse Methods</h2>
            <p>To tackle this multi-faceted problem, I designed and implemented an integrated analytical pipeline primarily using Python and key libraries (Pandas, GeoPandas, PySAL, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, SHAP). The innovation lies in combining spatial, machine learning, and causal inference perspectives for a more holistic understanding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spatial Statistics (GeoPandas, PySAL):</strong> Employed to understand the geographic distribution of key variables. Techniques like Moran's I (global spatial autocorrelation) and LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Association) were used to identify statistically significant hotspots and coldspots, revealing geographic clustering of environmental factors and deprivation. Getis-Ord Gi* helped pinpoint specific high/low value clusters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, SHAP):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Unsupervised Clustering (KMeans):</em> Chosen for its efficiency in partitioning Local Authority Districts (LADs) into distinct typologies based on pollution, deprivation, and health profiles. Its relative interpretability via cluster centroids was advantageous. Silhouette scores were monitored to help assess cluster separation quality. (Considered alternatives like DBSCAN, but KMeans proved more effective for identifying distinct, relatively balanced groups in this specific dataset).</li>
                        <li><em>Predictive Modelling (Gradient Boosting Regressor - GBR):</em> Selected for its strong predictive performance, ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and feature interactions, and inherent robustness to outliers, making it suitable for simulating potential policy impacts (e.g., effects of NO₂ reduction). Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation (assessing R-squared/MSE) to prevent overfitting.</li>
                        <li><em>Interpretability (SHAP):</em> Used alongside ML models (especially GBR and potentially clustering) to understand feature importance and how different factors (e.g., specific IMD domains) contribute to predictions or cluster formation, moving beyond black-box results.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- Corrected 'associational' -->
                    <strong>Causal Inference (Associational - Statsmodels):</strong> Applied Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to estimate the <em>associational</em> effect between high pollution exposure (treatment) and respiratory health (outcome) at the LAD level. PSM aims to create comparable groups by balancing observed socioeconomic confounders (IMD domains), approximating a quasi-experimental comparison. Rigorous diagnostic checks, particularly Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) plots, were essential to confirm covariate balance post-matching and assess the validity of the comparison.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Integration & Cleaning (Pandas, GeoPandas):</strong> Merged and meticulously cleaned complex datasets from diverse sources (ONS, DEFRA, DLUHC - IMD 2019, NHS Outcomes Framework) across different geographic scales (LSOA, LAD), handling missing values and ensuring spatial alignment.
                </li>

                <h3>Finding 1: Environmental Injustice is Spatially Concentrated</h3>
                <p>The analysis revealed that areas facing the "double disadvantage" of high pollution and high deprivation are not randomly distributed but cluster significantly, particularly in urban centres and specific post-industrial regions (as visually highlighted above). Spatial autocorrelation analysis confirmed these patterns were statistically significant.</p>

                <h3>Finding 2: High NO₂ Exposure Linked to Poorer Respiratory Health (Post-Matching)</h3>
                <p>Using Propensity Score Matching to control for observed IMD domains, I found a statistically significant negative association (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated, ATT ≈ -0.039, p<0.05) between higher NO₂ levels (above median) and poorer respiratory health outcomes at the LAD level. This suggests that even after accounting for area-level socioeconomic differences captured by the IMD, higher NO₂ exposure is associated with worse respiratory health indicators.</p>

                <h3>Finding 3: Distinct Area Typologies Emerge from Clustering</h3>
                <p>KMeans clustering identified distinct LAD profiles based on their combined pollution, deprivation, and health characteristics. For example, some areas suffer from high pollution and high deprivation ('Urban Deprived/Polluted'), while others might have moderate pollution but significantly worse health outcomes ('Deprived/Poor Health Focus'), suggesting that a one-size-fits-all policy approach is unlikely to be optimal. Tailored strategies are needed for different cluster types.</p>

The model identified specific LADs where such interventions are predicted to yield the largest health gains, allowing for prioritisation.</p>

                <p>Feature importance analysis (using SHAP values from relevant models) indicated that specific IMD domains, particularly 'Living Environment Deprivation' and 'Barriers to Housing & Services', were often stronger predictors of local pollution levels than income or employment deprivation alone. This suggests interventions need to consider these specific aspects of deprivation.</p>

            <h2>Impact & Actionable Insights</h2>
            <p>This analysis provides geographically specific, evidence-based intelligence for England policymakers and public health bodies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prioritise Resources Effectively:</strong> Focus interventions and funding on the identified LSOA-level hotspots (Finding 1) and the specific high-risk LAD clusters revealed by the typology analysis (Finding 3).</li>
                <li><strong>Target NO₂ Reduction Strategically:</strong> Implement and potentially intensify NO₂ reduction policies (e.g., Clean Air Zones, traffic management, promoting active travel) in areas identified as high-impact, particularly those highlighted by the PSM analysis (Finding 2) and policy simulations (Finding 4). Quantified impact suggests such measures could potentially improve health outcomes for an estimated <strong>~1.5 million residents</strong> (based on the total population of the top 10 LADs identified for prioritization).</li>
                <li><strong>Adopt a Holistic, Place-Based Approach:</strong> Recognise that pollution is intertwined with specific socioeconomic factors. Interventions should address key deprivation domains like poor housing quality and living environments alongside direct pollution control measures (Finding 5).</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage Coordinated Regional Action:</strong> The spatial clustering suggests pollution and deprivation issues often cross administrative boundaries. Leverage potential spatial spillover effects by encouraging coordinated mitigation strategies between neighbouring vulnerable LADs (Finding 1).</li>
