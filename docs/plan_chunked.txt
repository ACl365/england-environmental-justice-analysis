# Environmental Justice Project: 10 Separate Chunks

Here's your environmental justice project broken down into 10 separate, independently executable chunks:

## Chunk 1: Environment Setup and Data Import
- Set up conda environment with required packages
- Configure PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension
- Create schema structure (raw_data, processed_data, analysis, visualization)
- Import raw datasets into database
- Implement data validation checks
- **Outputs**: Database populated with raw datasets, validation report

## Chunk 2: Data Integration and Preprocessing
- Aggregate LSOA-level environmental data to LAD level
- Join with health indicators dataset
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Calculate basic descriptive statistics
- **Outputs**: Integrated dataset in database, data quality report
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunk 1

## Chunk 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Generate distributions of key variables
- Create correlation matrices
- Produce scatter plots of pollution vs. health outcomes
- Analyze relationships between deprivation and air quality
- **Outputs**: EDA visualizations, initial findings report
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunk 2

## Chunk 4: Environmental Vulnerability Index Development
- Normalize index components (pollution, deprivation, health)
- Implement weighting strategy for components
- Calculate composite vulnerability index
- Assign vulnerability quintiles
- Validate index against health outcomes
- **Outputs**: Vulnerability index dataset, technical documentation
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunk 2

## Chunk 5: Spatial Analysis
- Join data with geographic boundaries
- Create choropleth maps of vulnerability
- Perform global and local spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I, LISA)
- Identify spatial clusters and outliers
- **Outputs**: Spatial analysis results, maps, GIS files
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunk 4

## Chunk 6: Cluster Analysis for Area Typologies
- Select features for clustering
- Determine optimal number of clusters
- Implement k-means clustering
- Analyze cluster characteristics
- Define area typologies based on clusters
- **Outputs**: Cluster assignments, profiles for each cluster type
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunk 4

## Chunk 7: Intervention Prioritization Model
- Develop intervention potential scoring formula
- Calculate potential health benefits from interventions
- Rank areas by intervention priority
- Identify high-priority intervention areas
- **Outputs**: Intervention priority rankings, priority area report
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunks 4 and 6

## Chunk 8: Dashboard Development (Backend)
- Create data API endpoints for dashboard
- Implement data transformations for visualization
- Develop area profile data generation
- Build comparative analysis functions
- **Outputs**: Backend API, data processing modules
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunks 4, 5, and 7

## Chunk 9: Dashboard Development (Frontend)
- Implement interactive vulnerability map
- Create data visualization components
- Build filtering and selection interfaces
- Develop area profile display
- Implement "what-if" scenario functionality
- **Outputs**: Interactive web dashboard
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunk 8

## Chunk 10: Policy Analysis and Reporting
- Generate automated analysis reports for priority areas
- Create policy recommendation framework
- Produce intervention cost-benefit estimations
- Develop implementation roadmaps for high-priority areas
- **Outputs**: Policy recommendation report, implementation guides
- **Dependencies**: Requires outputs from Chunks 7 and 9

This chunked approach allows you to:
1. Complete work in manageable phases
2. Have clear deliverables for each chunk
3. Work on some chunks in parallel if resources allow
4. Demonstrate progress throughout the project
5. Focus on specific components based on priority

Each chunk builds on previous ones but has a defined scope and concrete outputs, making it easier to track progress and allocate resources effectively.
