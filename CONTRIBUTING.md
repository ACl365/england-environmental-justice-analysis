*   **Code Contributions:** We welcome code contributions, especially to address bugs or implement new features. To contribute code:
    1.  Fork the repository.
    2.  Create a new branch for your contribution (e.g., `feature/new-feature` or `fix/bug-fix`).
    3.  Make your changes, ensuring your code adheres to project style guidelines (see below).
    4.  Write tests for your changes.
    5.  Ensure all tests pass.
    6.  Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
    7.  Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Branching:** We use a feature branching workflow. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
2.  **Pull Requests:** Submit pull requests to the `main` branch. Ensure your pull request includes:
    *   A clear title and description of your changes.
    *   Links to relevant issues (if applicable).
    *   Confirmation that all tests pass.
    *   Adherence to code style guidelines.
3.  **Code Reviews:** All pull requests will be reviewed by project maintainers. Be responsive to feedback and be willing to make changes as requested.

## Setting up Development Environment

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd UK_ENV
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Code Style Guidelines

*   We follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guidelines for Python code.
*   Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
*   Write comments to explain complex logic.
*   Keep functions and code blocks concise and focused.

## Running Tests

*(Note: Instructions for running tests would be added here if tests are set up in the project)*
To run tests, use the following command:
```bash
# Example test command (replace with actual command if tests exist)
# pytest 
```

## Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

*   **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should represent a single, logical change. Avoid grouping unrelated changes into a single commit.
*   **Concise Summary Line:** Use a concise summary line (50 characters or less) that clearly describes the change.
*   **Detailed Explanation (if needed):** Provide a more detailed explanation in the body of the commit message if the summary line is not sufficient to fully explain the change. Explain the *why* behind the change, not just the *what*.
*   **Imperative Mood:** Use imperative mood in the summary line (e.g., "Fix bug..." instead of "Fixed bug...").
*   **Reference Issues:** Reference relevant issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123").
*   **Example:**
    ```
    Fix KeyError in calculate_pollution_deprivation_correlation

    The calculate_pollution_deprivation_correlation function was raising a KeyError because the 'PM10_normalized' column was not present in the DataFrame. This commit adds the 'PM10_normalized' column to the DataFrame to resolve this issue.
    ```
