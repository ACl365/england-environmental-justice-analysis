             <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
             <p>This project provides actionable intelligence for tackling environmental injustice in England by identifying specific communities facing a 'double burden' of high pollution and deprivation, linked to poorer respiratory health. Using an integrated approach combining spatial statistics, machine learning, and quasi-causal methods, key findings reveal:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt fa-fw"></i> <strong>Significant spatial clustering:</strong> Environmental injustice is geographically concentrated (Finding 1), enabling precise targeting of interventions away from broad-stroke approaches. Spatial autocorrelation techniques like Local Indicators of Spatial Association (<code>LISA</code>) confirmed these patterns were statistically significant.</li>
                 <li><i class="fas fa-lungs-virus fa-fw"></i> <strong>PM2.5 Health Association:</strong> Higher Particulate Matter < 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) exposure is significantly associated with poorer respiratory health outcomes, even after controlling for area deprivation (Finding 2, Propensity Score Matching (PSM) Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) <strong>≈ -0.0399</strong>, <strong>p ≈ 0.027</strong>). This suggests a direct health burden from fine particulate matter.</li>
                 <li><i class="fas fa-layer-group fa-fw"></i> <strong>Distinct Area Profiles:</strong> Local Authority Districts (LADs) cluster into typologies (e.g., 'Urban Deprived/Polluted') with unique challenge combinations, requiring tailored policy responses (Finding 3).</li>
             </ul>
             <!-- Refined Impact Caveat -->
             <p>The analysis enables efficient resource allocation by pinpointing high-risk Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) and LADs. Policy simulations suggest targeted PM2.5 reduction in priority areas could yield measurable health improvements. **Note:** Preliminary impact estimates (e.g., ~1.4M residents potentially benefiting, ~£60M potential NHS savings from a 20% PM2.5 reduction) require validation with official ONS population data but indicate substantial potential.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge: An Unequal Burden</h2>
            <p>Across England, disadvantaged communities often face disproportionately high levels of air pollution (like Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) and PM2.5). This recognised environmental injustice is strongly linked to poorer health outcomes, particularly respiratory conditions, exacerbating existing inequalities and placing significant burdens on public services like the NHS. Addressing this effectively requires moving beyond simple correlations to understand the complex interplay between where people live, their socioeconomic status, and their health.</p>
            <p><strong>My Goal:</strong> To rigorously analyse these connections using an integrated data science approach, identify high-risk areas with precision, and provide robust, data-driven evidence to support effective, targeted policy interventions.</p>

            <h2>My Analytical Approach: Integrating Diverse Methods</h2>
            <p>To tackle this multi-faceted problem, I designed and implemented an integrated analytical pipeline primarily using Python and key libraries (<code>Pandas</code>, <code>GeoPandas</code>, <code>PySAL</code>, <code>Scikit-learn</code>, <code>Statsmodels</code>, <code>SHAP</code>). The innovation lies in combining spatial, machine learning, and causal inference perspectives for a more holistic understanding, with careful consideration of methodological choices:</p>

                    <strong>Spatial Statistics (<code>GeoPandas</code>, <code>PySAL</code>):</strong> Employed spatial autocorrelation techniques (Moran's I, <code>LISA</code>, Getis-Ord Gi*) to rigorously test if patterns of pollution and deprivation were clustered or random. <strong class="justification-label">Justification:</strong> Standard statistics often assume independence, which is violated by geographic data; spatial methods account for this. <code>LISA</code> specifically identifies statistically significant local clusters (hotspots/coldspots), crucial for targeted interventions. <code>Queen contiguity</code> was chosen for spatial weights, suitable for administrative areas sharing borders. Spatial lag models were used later to account for spillover effects between neighbouring LADs, addressing potential bias in standard regression (Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)) from spatial dependence (indicated by the model's <code>rho coefficient</code>).

                        <li><em>Predictive Modelling (Gradient Boosting Regressor (<code>GBR</code>)):</em> Selected for policy simulation due to its strong predictive power, ability to model complex non-linear relationships and feature interactions (e.g., how deprivation modifies pollution impact), and robustness to outliers compared to linear models. <strong class="justification-label">Justification:</strong> <code>GBR</code> allowed simulating the potential impact of interventions (like PM2.5 reduction) on the respiratory health index, providing quantitative estimates for policy evaluation.

It aims to create comparable groups (high vs. low PM2.5) based on observed characteristics (checking for sufficient overlap via propensity score distributions), approximating a quasi-experimental setup to isolate the association of interest. Diagnostic checks confirmed that propensity score matching successfully balanced observed covariates like IMD domains between the high and low PM2.5 groups (Standardised Mean Differences (SMDs) < 0.1 post-matching), strengthening the comparison. While acknowledging limitations (cannot control for <em>unobserved</em> confounders), rigorous diagnostics (sensitivity analysis via <code>Rosenbaum bounds</code>) were performed to assess the robustness of the association found (ATT).

                <h3>Finding 1: Environmental Injustice is Spatially Concentrated</h3>
                <p>The analysis revealed that areas facing the "double disadvantage" of high pollution and high deprivation are not randomly distributed but cluster significantly, particularly in urban centres and specific post-industrial regions (as visually highlighted above). Spatial autocorrelation analysis confirmed these patterns were statistically significant.</p>

                <h3>Finding 2: High PM2.5 Exposure Linked to Poorer Respiratory Health (Post-Matching)</h3>
                <!-- Added brief interpretation -->
                <p>Using PSM to control for observed IMD domains, I found a statistically significant negative association between higher PM2.5 levels (above median) and the respiratory health index at the LAD level (ATT <strong>≈ -0.0399</strong>, p-value <strong>≈ 0.027</strong>). <strong>Interpretation:</strong> This suggests that, holding observed deprivation factors constant, moving from lower to higher PM2.5 exposure is associated with a roughly <strong>4.0% relative decrease</strong> in the respiratory health index across matched LADs. While PSM cannot establish definitive causation due to potential unobserved confounders, the statistically significant result (<strong>p<0.05</strong>) provides stronger evidence for a link between PM2.5 and poorer respiratory health, independent of measured deprivation. The matching process successfully balanced observed covariates, as shown below.</p>

                <p><code>K-Means</code> clustering identified distinct LAD profiles based on their combined pollution, deprivation, and health characteristics. For example, some areas suffer from high pollution and high deprivation ('Urban Deprived/Polluted'), while others might have moderate pollution but significantly worse health outcomes ('Deprived/Poor Health Focus'), suggesting that a one-size-fits-all policy approach is unlikely to be optimal. Tailored strategies are needed for different cluster types.</p>

                <p>Policy simulations using the trained <code>GBR</code> estimated the potential impact of PM2.5 reduction. <strong>Example Scenario:</strong> A simulated <strong>20% reduction</strong> in PM2.5 levels was predicted to yield an average improvement of <strong>~0.0013</strong> in the respiratory health index across relevant LADs, with larger gains in specific areas (e.g., Southend-on-Sea, Wigan, Bury, Leeds, Westminster, Eastbourne, Portsmouth, Salford, Manchester, Blaby). <strong>Implication:</strong> This quantifies the potential benefit of targeted interventions, allowing policymakers to prioritise areas like specific LAD clusters (e.g., Cluster 2: 'Urban Deprived/Polluted') where PM2.5 reduction could improve health outcomes for residents. While precise NHS cost savings are complex to model, reducing respiratory illness burden through such measures could hypothetically lead to substantial long-term savings via reduced hospital admissions and treatments (further economic analysis recommended).</p>

Preliminary impact estimates (e.g., ~1.4M residents potentially benefiting, ~£60M potential NHS savings from a 20% PM2.5 reduction) require validation with official ONS population data but indicate substantial potential. This targeted approach could potentially reduce NHS burden associated with respiratory conditions (requires dedicated health economic modelling citing sources like NICE/DoH).</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-people-arrows fa-fw"></i> <strong>Design Holistic, Place-Based Interventions:</strong> Address the interconnected nature of pollution and deprivation. Policy should integrate pollution control with measures tackling key deprivation drivers like poor housing ('Living Environment Deprivation') and access barriers ('Barriers to Housing & Services') identified as critical factors (<strong>Finding 5</strong>).</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-handshake fa-fw"></i> <strong>Foster Coordinated Regional Strategies:</strong> Recognise that environmental injustice transcends administrative boundaries (<strong>Finding 1</strong>).

             <h2>Limitations & Key Assumptions</h2>
             <p>While providing robust insights, this analysis acknowledges key limitations and assumptions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw"></i> <strong>Causal Claims (PSM):</strong> Propensity Score Matching strengthens associational claims by controlling for <em>observed</em> confounders (IMD domains), but cannot establish definitive causation due to the potential influence of unobserved factors (e.g., individual behaviour, specific local policies). Findings represent strong associations.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw"></i> <strong>Ecological Fallacy:</strong> Conclusions are based on area-level data (LAD/LSOA) and may not perfectly reflect individual-level risks or experiences within those areas.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw"></i> <strong>Data Timeliness & Granularity:</strong> Findings are based on specific data snapshots (e.g., IMD 2019, specific pollution years). Relationships may evolve, and finer-grained temporal or spatial data could reveal further nuances.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw"></i> <strong>Model Assumptions:</strong> Results are contingent on the assumptions of the chosen models (e.g., linearity assumptions in parts of PSM, parameter choices in <code>K-Means</code>/<code>GBR</code>).</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw"></i> <strong>Ethical Considerations & Bias:</strong> Potential biases in source data (e.g., pollution monitor placement, reporting variations in health data) could influence results. While steps were taken to use validated indices and check model robustness, interpretations must consider the risk of perpetuating existing biases if applied without care. Responsible AI principles guided the analysis.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw"></i> <strong>NO₂ Analysis Results:</strong> The propensity score matching analysis for NO₂ yielded a non-significant association (p ≈ 0.30) after controlling for observed confounders, suggesting that while NO₂ remains a concern, the evidence for its independent impact (separate from deprivation) in this specific analysis is less statistically robust than for PM2.5. Further investigation with different model specifications or data could be warranted.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw"></i> <strong>Impact Quantification Data:</strong> Impact quantifications (QALYs, cost savings) are preliminary estimates based on placeholder population data and require recalculation using official ONS figures for validation.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><i class="fas fa-search-location fa-fw"></i> <strong>Granularity & Context:</strong> Integrate finer-grained data (e.g., hyperlocal sensors, individual surveys if ethically feasible) to reduce ecological fallacy. Complement quantitative findings with qualitative research (community interviews) for richer context.</li>

                        <li><em>Monitoring & Retraining:</em> Conceptualise a monitoring system (e.g., using tools like <code>MLflow</code>, <code>Evidently AI</code>) to track data drift (pollution patterns, demographics changing) and model drift (relationships changing). Define retraining triggers and frequency.</li>
                        <li><em>Automation:</em> Frame the <code>run_*.py</code> scripts as components of an automated pipeline (e.g., using <code>Airflow</code> or <code>Prefect</code>) for regular data updates and analysis runs.</li>
